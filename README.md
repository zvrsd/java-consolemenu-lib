# java-consolemenu-lib

The purpose of this is to create a menu interface for CLI applications/programs

It has been designed so you can setup and navigate through your menu elements without much effort and complexity

Few things that can be done :
- Menu elements can be added into another
- Menu elements can be nested wihtout limits
- Each menu element can contains at most 32 menu elements ( can be modified )
- Possibility to go back to the previous element or back to the main element
- Set specific code to execute when a menu element is selected

A basic example about how it works can be found into "src/examples"
